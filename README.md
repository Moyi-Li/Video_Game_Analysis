Besides, we created a test file [small_ds_test.csv](https://github.com/Moyi-Li/CSE163_Project) for testing the functionality. Feel free to click the link and downloads the dataset!

## Running programs
To run our programs, you can firstly run the program **data_cleaning.py** to preprocess the data reading part. Then, you can freely run the main program **main.py** to check the results. You can also use the small dataset **test.py** which used the small dataset to prove the function run properly.
